This is the repository for Surain Saigal's algorithm visualizer. You may use the live tool [here](https://surainsaigal.github.io/algorithm-visualizer).

This a simple sorting algorithm visualizer which allows a student to easily visualize the processes behind insertion sort, bubble sort, and mergesort. The tool is intended to be sleek, allowing users to easily select an algorithm and an array size, and then displaying interactive animations with a strong use of color. The tool was developed using CSS animations, TailwindCSS, and Next.js, and all code is documented and commented well. Made by Surain Saigal.
